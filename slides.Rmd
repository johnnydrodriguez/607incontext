## Applied Sentiment Analysis:  IT Support Tickets
We'll explore sentiment analysis for a 2022  IT Service Desk data set containing 6900 IT support tickets/requests.


...And my real-world attempt to address a critical function of that IT Service Desk.

## Background and Context
I am the manager for IT support services team for faculty, staff and students at a liberal arts college in New York City.  

<br/>

* 1000 faculty and administrative staff  
* 2600 undergrad students
* Generate any where from 8,000-10,000 IT service requests per year
* The data set we are looking at today is from my college / job 

## What makes for a good IT Service Desk and a good organization for its employees?

* The holy grail for a customer support organization (including IT support) is **customer satisfaction**.

* The holy grail for worker retention is **employee satisfaction**.

* To maximize satisfaction, every interaction matters. 

<br/>

> Organizations work best when their customers and their employees are ***happy***.

> But **happy** is hard to measure.

## Conventional Ways to Measure IT Service Desk performance

IT support and service organizations are full of **vanity metrics**

> ***Vanity metrics are metrics that make you look good to others but do not help you understand your own performance in a way that informs future strategies.***

* Average number of tickets assigned / resolved by an analyst

* Average hold time on call

* Average call time duration

* Average time to resolution

<br/>

The key question to identify these is **So What?**

## To illustrate the point...

Vanity metrics don't offer much value, don't lead to decisions or actions & **incentivize wrong behaviors in search of hitting the metric.**

```

## Customer and Employee Satisfaction Surveys

Customer and employee satisfaction surveys are a common way to try to assess customer and employee happiness.  

> "How did we do?"

> "Rate us a 5"


## But...
These surveys tend to suffer from all sorts of response biases.

```

## Enter Sentiment Analysis

* In the process of exploring sentiment analysis as an alternative to this method.  

* Up until now, we had been focused on improving the survey mechanism.

* Sentiment analysis allows for a more detailed understanding on 'sentiment' at a per ticket/per customer / per employee level.

* The analysis can be performed across the entire data set - i.e.,  all tickets in the dataset.

* The analyst can be done in with tickets that are still open or recently closed.


## A few words about the data set..

* It is from a commercial / enterprise Service Desk ticketing system

* It contains all tickets opened from Jan 1 2022 - Nov 4, 2022

* Names have been changed to protect the innocent

* For reasons confidentiality and data sensitivity, the dialogue columns have been removed from the dataset before a clean dataset was published to github.  Only the sentence sentiment scores and word counts are included.


## A few words about the Sentiment Analysis - SentimentR


```{r img-with-knitr3, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap=''}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydrodriguez/607incontext/main/sentimentr.png")

```

## The Customer & Analyst Dialogue 
```{r img-with-knitr4, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap=''}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydrodriguez/607incontext/main/example_dialogue.png")

```

## Original Source Data
1. The original data set was imported from a local file.  
2. The dialogue columns were removed.
```{r img-with-knitr5, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', fig.cap=''}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydrodriguez/607incontext/main/sourcecode2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydrodriguez/607incontext/main/sourcedata.png")

```

## Profanity Check

Before the dialogue columns were removed, sentimentr allows for a profanity check

```{r img-with-knitr6, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap=''}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydrodriguez/607incontext/main/profanitycode.png")


```

## Profanity Results
Abusive language violates the College's code of conduct and HR employee policies.

In my data set, no profanities was discovered when evaluating individual sentences.

```

## Exploring IT Support Sentiment

```{r echo = FALSE ,warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

ticketsdata2022 <- read.csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydrodriguez/607incontext/main/ticketsdata2022_clean.csv", 
  na.strings=c("","NA"))

glimpse(ticketsdata2022)

 # knitr::kable(head(ticketsdata2022, n=15,
 #                   format="latex", longtable = T, booktabs=TRUE))%>%
 #   kable_styling(font_size = 8)

```

## Distribution of Sentiment Across the IT Organization: Overall Positive

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', fig.cap=''}
# Density plot distribution of sentiment scores
ticketsdata2022 %>% ggplot() + geom_density(aes(sentiment))+ 
  ggtitle("IT Support Requests Sentiment Distribution")+ theme_minimal()
```

## Distribution of Sentiment by IT Group: Overall Positive
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', fig.cap=''}
ticketsdata2022 %>% ggplot() + geom_density(aes(sentiment))+
  ggtitle("IT Support Requests Sentiment Distribution by IT Group")+
  facet_wrap(~ assignment_group)+theme_minimal()
```

## Sentiment Range: A Rollercoaster

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap=''}
#Boxplot
ticketsdata2022 %>% ggplot() + geom_boxplot(aes(x = sentiment, y = assignment_group))+
   ggtitle("IT Support Requests Sentiment Range")
```

## Opportunity:  Neutral Sentiment
```{r fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap=''}

ticketsdata2022  %>%
  mutate(polarity_level = case_when(sentiment == 0 ~ "Neutral",
                                    sentiment > 0 ~ "Positive",
                                    sentiment < 0 ~ "Negative"))%>% 
  count(assignment_group, polarity_level) %>% 
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n)*100) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = reorder(assignment_group, prop), y = prop, fill = polarity_level))+
  ggtitle("Sentiment Polarity by Group")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=.5, hjust=.33))+
  coord_flip()

```

## Sentiment for Service Desk Analysts

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap=''}
ticketsdata2022  %>%
  filter(assigned_to %in% c( "John", "Nora", "Paul", "Justin", "Vicky", "Brian", "Ray", "Laura")) %>% 
  mutate(polarity_level = case_when(sentiment == 0 ~ "Neutral",
                                    sentiment > 0 ~ "Positive",
                                    sentiment < 0 ~ "Negative")) -> sdsentiment

sdsentiment %>% 
  count(assigned_to, polarity_level) %>% 
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n)*100) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = reorder(assigned_to, prop), y = prop, fill = polarity_level))+
  theme_minimal()+
  coord_flip()

```

## Nora's Negative Sentiment Tickets

Is it Nora?  Is it the customer?  Is the technology?

## Sentiment Analysis Opens Up Avenues of Exploration

* By Analyst / IT Group

* By Customer / Customer Group (Projects, Special Initiatives)

* By Academic or Administrative Dept (HR, History, etc)

* By Support Category (Hardware, Software, Password, etc)

* By Seasonality/Time (Term Start, Midterms, Finals, etc)



## Conclusions (and Takeaways from my experience)

* At least in this use case, sentiment analysis is a superior way to identify areas for improvement -- but further vetting is needed.

* Domain expertise is important to identify areas of focus which may warrant further analysis & which areas do not.

* Sentiment analysis allowed us to detect negative sentiments over shorter intervals of time and while they were occurring.
